# pack

Pack all files related to your project into one file suitable for shipping and extract them when required.

pack is written in python. All files and directories in folder 'in' are collated into one file named target.dat ( target 
is target as chosen in pack ). when extracted, all files and dirs are extracted into folder target.

Todo:

- [ ] add support for command-line arguments 
- [ ] add batch file support for direct usage as an installer
